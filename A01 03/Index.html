<h2>History</h2>

<p>
    In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, then a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for 
    CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based 
    hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That 
    year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, 
    but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990 Berners-Lee listed some of the 
    many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first entry
