					The sky is an unobstructed view upward from the surface of the Earth. It includes the
					atmosphere and outer space. It may also be considered a place between the ground and outer
					space, thus distinct from outer space. In the field of astronomy, the sky is also called
					the celestial sphere. This is an abstract sphere, concentric to the Earth, on which the
					Sun, Moon, planets, and stars appear to be drifting. The celestial sphere is
					conventionally divided into designated areas called constellations.
