				<p class="text">
					Most mechanics specialize in a particular field, such as auto body mechanics, air
					conditioning and refrigeration mechanics, auto mechanics, bicycle mechanics, boiler
					mechanics, race car mechanics, aircraft mechanics, and other areas. A mechanic is
					typically certified by a trade association or regional government power. Mechanics may be
					separated into two classes based on the type of machines they work on, heavyweight and
					lightweight. Heavyweight work is on larger machines or heavy equipment, such as tractors
					and trailers, while lightweight work is on smaller items, such as automotive engines.
