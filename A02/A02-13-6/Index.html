                The ocean (also known as the sea or the world ocean) is a body of salt water that covers approximately
                70.8% of the Earth and contains 97% of Earth's water.[10] The term ocean also refers to any of the large
                bodies of water into which the world ocean is conventionally divided.[11] Distinct names are used to
                identify five different areas of the ocean: Pacific (the largest), Atlantic, Indian, Southern, and
                Arctic (the smallest).[12][13] Seawater covers approximately 361,000,000 km2 (139,000,000 sq mi) of the
                planet. The ocean is the primary component of the Earth's hydrosphere, and thus essential to life on
                Earth. The ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle by
                acting as a huge heat reservoir.
