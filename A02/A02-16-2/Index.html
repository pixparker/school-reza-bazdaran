			<p class="desc">
				A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater stream, flowing on the surface
				or inside caves towards another waterbody at a lower elevation, such as an ocean, sea, bay,
				lake, wetland, or another river. In some cases, a river flows into the ground or becomes dry
				at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be
				referred to using names such as creek, brook, and rivulet. There are no official definitions
				for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or
				communities, a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to
				geographic location; examples are "run" in some parts of the United States, "burn" in
				Scotland and Northeast England, and "beck" in Northern England. Sometimes a river is defined
				as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.
