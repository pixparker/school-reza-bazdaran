					CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout,
					colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more
					flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable
					multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
					file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .

					Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup
					page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by
					voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices.
					CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.

					In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed andprototyped ENQUIRE,

						In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-basedhypertext system.

					That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systemsengineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a
					joint request for funding, but theproject was not formally adopted by CERN. In his
					personal notes from 1990 helisted "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and
					put anencyclopedia first.The draft expired after six months, but was notable for
					itsacknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images,
					reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successfulprototypes. Similarly,
					Dave Raggett's competing Internet-Draft, "HTML+(Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993,
					suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.
