				A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show
				significant exposed bedrock. Although definitions vary, a mountain may differ from a plateau
				in having a limited summit area, and is usually higher than a hill, typically rising at
				least 300 metres (980 ft) above the surrounding land. A few mountains are isolated summits,
				but most occur in mountain ranges.
